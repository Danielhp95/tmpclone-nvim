*tmpclone-nvim* : A small tool to help you temporarily clone repositories to
navigate in nvim.

Motivation: Navigating code via Github and derivatives is annoying, most developers whom
use nvim will surely have a workflow for navigating code which is superior to
the aforementioned websites.

This plugin gives the following functionality:
  1. Clone repos into a temporary data folder
  2. Navigate those repositories with all nvim tooling
  3. Seemlessly switch between "local" files and cloned repositories by
  managing switching the working directory under the hood.
  4. Remove cloned repos when they are no longer needed.
